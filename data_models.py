"""
Database models for a simple library application using Flask-SQLAlchemy.

This module defines two ORM models:
- Author: Represents an author with basic biographical details (name, birth and death dates).
          Each author can be associated with multiple books.
- Book:   Represents a book entry in the library, including ISBN, title,
          publication year, optional cover URL, and a reference to its author.

The Author â†” Book relationship is one-to-many:
- One author can have many books.
- Each book belongs to exactly one author.

These models are intended for use in a Flask application configured with SQLAlchemy.
